# Sign_Language_Glove
This project aims to develop a glove that can convert the 26 American Sign Language (ASL) alphabet symbols into text. This would help people who are unable to speak or communicate verbally, such as those who are born without the capacity to talk or those who have lost their ability to speak due to an accident.
